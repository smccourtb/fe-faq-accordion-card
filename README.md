## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS only accordion
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have avoided accordions until now but they arent that bad and alot of style and usefulness to a project

### Continued development

This challenge was the trickiest for me by far. Accordions were new, as well as positioning with relative and absolute. Positioning the images were the most challenging for me so in the future I will be focusing on using position attributes more.
